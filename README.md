# DINO-Game-AI

This repository contains an implementation of a genetic algorithm to train an AI agent to play a recreated version of the famous Chrome Dino game.

Overview : 
The Dino game is a simple, offline game that has been recreated for the purposes of this project. This project leverages the principles of genetic algorithms to evolve an AI agent capable of playing the game autonomously.

Features:
Genetic Algorithm: Utilizes selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve the AI agent.
Neural Network: The agent's decision-making is powered by a neural network.
Game Integration: Seamlessly integrates with the recreated Dino game for real-time training and evaluation.
